Title: Pharmacokinetics with PKSmart
Description: PKSmart contains a suite of ML models to predict clearance (CL), 
  volume of distribution (VDss), fraction unbound in plasma (fup), mean 
  residence time (MRT) and half-life (thalf) of small molecules in the human 
  body. It has been built using a surrogate modelling approach. Models developed
  for  monkey, rat and dog were trained and then used to predict >1000 molecules
  with human PK parameters
