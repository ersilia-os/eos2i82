Title: Pharmacokinetics with PKSmart
Description: PKSmart contains a suite of ML models to predict clearance (CL), volume
  of distribution (VDss), fraction unbound in plasma (fup), mean residence time (MRT)
  and half-life (thalf) of small molecules in the human body. It has been built using
  a surrogate modelling approach. Models developed for  monkey, rat and dog were trained
  and then used to predict >1000 molecules with human PK parameters
